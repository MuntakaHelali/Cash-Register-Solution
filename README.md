# Cash-Register-Solution

The premise of this C# Application is to mimic transactions from a customer, update both the balances of the customer and cash register, and display the expected and actual value of the cash in the till. 
The solution allows for the top-level statements to simulate the transactions using randomly generated item costs, generate random values for the cost of the item the customer purchases between the range of 2 - 49, and simulate 100 transactions.
Finally, the solution succesfully displays the balanced till value with the expected value.
